# sudo !!

If you ran a command which failed because you forgot to run it as root, you needn't type the whole command again. You can just run
```bash
sudo !!
```
and this will rerun the previous command with sudo.

In unix, the `!` character can be used to access your bash history in several ways. `!!` stands for the previous command that you zran.
